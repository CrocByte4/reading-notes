# reading-notes

Hello there, I'm Joe. I am learning how to be a software developer, and some day I plan on immigrating to Australia.

This is my reading notes for the full stack coding bootcamp. I might even get good at it some day.

Growth mindset is the way of looking positively at your learning experiences.
