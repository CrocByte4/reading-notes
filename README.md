## Who am I?

Hello there, I'm Joe. I am learning how to be a software developer, and some day I plan on immigrating to Australia.

## What is this website?

This is my reading notes for the full stack coding bootcamp. I might even get good at it some day.

## What is growth mindset?

Growth mindset is the way of looking positively at your learning experiences.

## How do I keep in a growth mindset?

1. I recognise that while others may be performing better than me, there was a time when they too struggled.
    The experience of my peers is invaluable, so I am having trouble I should ask them for their insight.
2. While I may find it hard to keep at the task at hand I remember that you can only grow by challenging yourself, and that things only become easy after they were hard.
3. At times I may doubt myself and feel as though I have to overcome a mountain, but I stay positive and understand that it takes time to build up skills.
